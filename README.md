Note Taker
Description
Note Taker is a web-based application that enables users to create, save, and delete notes. The application uses an Express.js backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. This project was created for Module 11 Challenge Assignment of the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development boot camp.

User Story
As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

Acceptance Criteria
Given a note-taking application:

When I open the Note Taker, then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
When I click on the link to the notes page, then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
When I click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column.
When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
